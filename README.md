Elementa is a free and open-source icon library with over 200 icons. In a world, where every second day we have a new icon library, Elementa tries to provide a unique flavor to its design ideology which is fun, playful, and on-point.

Elementa is open to be used in personal and commercial projects, be it digital or non-digital enabling developers and designers to create beautiful apps and end-user experience rather than a new icon library.
